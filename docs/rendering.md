# Rendering

The renderer is the only component in `@choo-choo/core` that emits SVG. It is a **pure function** that consumes a `Diagram` IR tree (see [`ir.md`](./ir.md)) and returns a self-contained SVG string. It never touches the DOM, depends on no runtime globals, and is safe to call on any JavaScript runtime (Node, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, browsers).

## Contract

```ts
function render(diagram: Diagram, options?: RenderOptions): string;
```

- **Input**: a `Diagram` node. Any other input is a programming error.
- **Output**: a single `<svg>...</svg>` string, self-contained and valid as a standalone document. The caller decides whether to inline it, write it to disk, or inject it via `innerHTML`.
- **Determinism**: given the same IR and options, `render` always returns the same string. No `Date.now()`, no random IDs, no environment reads.
- **Purity**: `render` does not mutate its inputs and has no observable side effects.
- **SSR-safety**: `render` never references `window`, `document`, `globalThis` DOM APIs, or any platform-specific global.

## Render options

```ts
interface RenderOptions {
  emitSourceData?: boolean; // default false — see § Source location attributes
  verticalSeparation?: number; // vertical gap between stacked lanes, in px. Default: 8
  arcRadius?: number; // radius of route arcs, in px. Default: 10
  diagramPadding?: number; // padding inside the outer <svg> viewBox, in px. Default: 10
  strokeWidth?: number; // stroke-width applied to rails and box outlines, in px. Default: 1
}
```

All options are optional with documented defaults. The renderer must not read from a global default object; defaults are inlined in the entry point.

Future options will be additive. Removing or changing the semantics of an existing option is a breaking change.

## Output shape

The renderer emits exactly one `<svg>` element. Its attributes:

- `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"`
- `class="choo-choo"` — the root hook for the shipped `railroad.css`.
- `viewBox="0 0 W H"` where `W` and `H` are the diagram's outer dimensions including `diagramPadding`.
- `width` and `height` in pixels, matching the `viewBox` extents.

Inside the `<svg>`, the structure is a tree of nested `<g>` groups, one per IR node. Every group carries a CSS class that mirrors the node's `kind`:

| IR `kind`     | SVG group class    |
|---------------|--------------------|
| `diagram`     | `diagram`          |
| `start`       | `start`            |
| `end`         | `end`              |
| `terminal`    | `terminal`         |
| `nonterminal` | `non-terminal`     |
| `special`     | `special`          |
| `comment`     | `comment`          |
| `sequence`    | `sequence`         |
| `choice`      | `choice`           |
| `optional`    | `optional`         |
| `repetition`  | `repetition`       |
| `group`       | `group`            |
| `skip`        | `skip`             |

Groups nest according to the IR tree. Children appear as children in document order. This makes it trivial to:

- style a diagram with CSS (`.choo-choo .terminal rect { … }`),
- query specific parts in tests (`.querySelector(".choo-choo .choice .terminal")`),
- map SVG fragments back to IR nodes by position in the tree.

## Coordinate system and layout model

choo-choo uses the standard SVG coordinate system (origin top-left, y grows downward). The layout model comes straight from the legacy project (and the wider railroad-diagrams tradition) because the geometry has been battle-tested for twenty years:

Every node has four measurements, computed before any SVG is emitted:

- **`width`** — horizontal extent.
- **`up`** — vertical extent *above* the rail line.
- **`down`** — vertical extent *below* the rail line.
- **`height`** — derived: `up + down`.

The **rail line** is the horizontal axis on which each node is threaded. A terminal centers its box on the rail; a sequence lays children along the rail; a choice offsets alternatives above (`up`) and below (`down`) the rail, joined by arcs.

Layout proceeds in two logical phases, though an implementation may fuse them:

1. **Measure (bottom-up).** The visitor walks the tree and returns `{ width, up, down }` for each node, combining child measurements.
2. **Emit (top-down).** With measurements known, the visitor walks the tree again and emits `<g transform="translate(x, y)">` groups at the correct positions, drawing rails, arcs, boxes, and text.

Implementers may cache measurements off-tree (e.g. a `Map<Node, Measurements>` or a parallel tree) — the IR itself is never mutated.

## Per-node rendering

This section fixes the *visual intent* of each node kind: what shape, what text, which connecting rails. Exact pixel offsets live in code and are pinned by snapshot tests.

### `diagram`

Outer container. Emits the root `<svg>` and the end-cap `start` / `end` markers, then renders `child` on the rail between them. If `child` renders taller than the markers, the markers sit on the rail at the correct vertical offset.

### `start` / `end`

Short rail stubs terminating in a vertical bar (`simple`) or double bar (`complex`). The `label` on `start`, if present, is drawn as text above the marker.

### `terminal`

A rounded-end rectangle (stadium shape) centered on the rail, containing the text. If `href` is set, the whole group is wrapped in an `<a>` element. If `title` is set, a `<title>` child is added to the group for native SVG tooltips.

### `nonterminal`

A plain rectangle centered on the rail, containing the name. Same `href` / `title` behaviour as `terminal`.

### `special`

A hexagon-ish shape (distinct from `terminal` and `nonterminal`) centered on the rail, containing the text. Same `href` / `title` behaviour.

### `comment`

Free-standing text drawn on the rail. No surrounding shape. Same `href` / `title` behaviour. Used to annotate a diagram without implying a grammar production.

### `sequence`

Children drawn left to right, joined end-to-end on the same rail. No extra glyphs.

### `choice`

Children are stacked vertically and centered on the `normal` index (which sits on the rail). Other children are offset above (smaller indices) and below (larger indices). Incoming and outgoing rails branch from the main rail via arcs — up-arc into the top child, down-arc into the bottom, etc. — and rejoin symmetrically on the right side.

### `optional`

A child wrapped in a skip-around path. The skip arcs above (`skip: "top"`) or below (`skip: "bottom"`) the child; the forward rail goes straight through the child.

### `repetition`

The child sits on the rail, and a return path arcs below it from the right back to the left. If `separator` is present, it is drawn on the return path, in the reverse direction.

### `group`

A dashed rectangle surrounding the child's bounding box, with the optional `label` drawn above the top edge. The child renders unchanged; `group` contributes padding but no rail modification.

### `skip`

A straight rail segment with no glyph. Its `width` is the minimum that keeps arcs meeting cleanly in the parent layout.

## Source location attributes

When `options.emitSourceData === true`, every `<g>` whose corresponding IR node carries a `source` range receives the following attributes:

| Attribute                      | Value                                                |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `data-source-offset-start`     | `source.start.offset`                                |
| `data-source-offset-end`       | `source.end.offset`                                  |
| `data-source-line-start`       | `source.start.line`                                  |
| `data-source-line-end`         | `source.end.line`                                    |
| `data-source-column-start`     | `source.start.column`                                |
| `data-source-column-end`       | `source.end.column`                                  |

Nodes without a `source` field (e.g. anything produced by the manual builder) get no `data-source-*` attributes, regardless of the flag.

When `emitSourceData` is `false` (the default), **no** `data-source-*` attributes are emitted, even if the IR carries `source`. This keeps the common-case SVG clean and predictable.

## Errors

The renderer throws a `TypeError` with a descriptive message in exactly these situations:

- The root is not a `Diagram` node (`kind !== "diagram"`).
- A node's `kind` is not a member of the union (unknown / misspelt).
- An invariant guaranteed by the IR spec is violated in a way the renderer cannot recover from safely (e.g. a `Choice` with fewer than two children). The renderer does not re-validate routine invariants — it assumes producers respect the IR contract — but it will throw rather than emit malformed SVG.

Errors are thrown synchronously. The renderer never partially returns; a thrown error means *no* SVG was produced.

## Relation to other parts of the system

- The **manual builder** (`docs/builder.md`) produces IR that the renderer accepts verbatim.
- **Grammar parsers** (`docs/grammars/*.md`) produce IR with `source` populated; the renderer honours it under `emitSourceData`.
- **Framework bindings** (`docs/bindings/*.md`) call `render` internally and pass the returned string to their framework's HTML-insertion mechanism. Bindings do not reach into the renderer's internals.
- The **stylesheet** `railroad.css` ships alongside `core`. It is *not* inlined into the SVG by the renderer; consumers choose whether to import it.

## Open questions

- **Layout debugging mode** — an option to draw bounding boxes / measurement debug overlays. Deferred; useful when we start having regressions but not needed for 0.1.
- **Custom text metrics** — text width today is estimated from a fixed character-width heuristic inherited from the legacy project. Real glyph metrics would need a font provider abstraction. Deferred to a later release.
- **Multi-diagram documents** — emitting several diagrams in one SVG (for a full grammar) is currently the consumer's job (call `render` per rule, stack the results). A `renderGrammar(...)` helper could be offered later if there is demand.
